gr-pulseaudio
=============

Audio source and sink blocks for GNU Radio using PulseAudio.

Current status: works, but needs review from experienced GNU Radio and
PulseAudio developers.

[GQRX also appears to have PulseAudio sources and sinks](https://github.com/csete/gqrx/tree/master/pulseaudio),
though they do need seem to be structured with the intent of for standalone use.
